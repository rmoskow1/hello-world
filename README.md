# hello-world
a sad yet hopefully promising attempt
A bit about me.....
My name is Racheli. I'm a college student now, and first stumbled upon coding in AP Computer Science in high school. I ended up loving the class...it was one of those classes that you come out of the class feeling like you know infinitely less than you started with - and that's a good thing. 
I used to work only with Java. But now I've tasted the blissful world of Python and I'm not sure I'm ever going back. 
Maybe I'll be a computer science major. Maybe I'll be a doctor who likes to code. 

We'll see. For now, I'm just gonna try and become slightly less ignorant...(if I could stop watching Sherlock long enough to actually do something intelligent with my time)
